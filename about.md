I am a Software Engineer passionate in Cloud engineering and Golang programming. I have several years of industry experience and proven ability to design, develop, and deploy scalable and reliable applications. I also have expertise in CI/CD, automation, and application release management.

I am an individual contributor who loves to learn and experiment with new technologies. I am also a strong advocate for open source software and I am always looking for ways to share my knowledge with the community.

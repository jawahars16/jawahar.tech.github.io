Traditional applications follow castle and moat security model. Also referred as Perimeter Security. Applications/data are protected by one thick layer of security. Inside the layer, everyone is trusted. Outside the layer, no one is trusted.

Problems with Permeter security,

- One breach is enough to compromise the whole system.
- In today's micro-services world, majority of traffic is east-west **.

This is where, zero trust comes into picture. Build and protect your system as if the attacker is already penetrated the perimeter.

Principles of Zero Trust Security Model,

- No inside. No outside.
- Trust no one.
- Least Privilege
- Always verify.

** East-West: Traffic between services. North-West: External traffic.

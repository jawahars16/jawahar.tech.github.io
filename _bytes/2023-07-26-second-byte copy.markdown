#### Automate! automate! automate !

Automate everything including the infrastructure creation, application build, test, deployment cycle, workload scaling up / down and so on.

#### Defence in depth

Trust no one. Traditional applications are protected more from external traffic and considered internal traffic as always secure. But protect every layer and every service as if there is no difference between inside and outside.

#### Be observable

Make sure to have the ability to determine the internal state/health of the apps based on the data it generates in real time. Logs, metrics and traces are the most common. 

#### Optimise for cost

Keep a close eye on your spendings. Cloud is all about “pay per use”. Make sure your provisioned capacity and usage are close to each other. If not, optimize.

#### Stay upto date

Make sure to keep everything up-to date including application dependencies, cloud resources, database engine and so on. The longer you wait to update, the more you suffer.

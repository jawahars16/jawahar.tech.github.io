Different types cloud designs can be adopted based on the needs of the organization. For example, a hybrid cloud is a combination of both Google cloud and on-premise cloud. A multi cloud is a combination of Google cloud and AWS duplicating the services. Cloud agnostic is the key in multi cloud design. A poly cloud is a combination of Google cloud and AWS with some specialized services utilized in each cloud.

Below is a fair comparison of different cloud designs.
